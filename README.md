# EvolutionStrategyHistogramEqualization

%% Evolution Strategy Algorithm Histogram Equalization - Created in 18 Jan 2022 by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi
% These lines of code apply Evolution Strategy algorithm on input
% argument of "target histogram" in Histogram Equalization function in
% order to fit the model in an evolutionary form. System uses some pre and
% post processing techniques which could be used as an image enhancement
% method. Obviously, you can use your own image and play with parameters
% depending on your desire. This code is suitable for medical purposes as
% reveals some veins and tissues in low and high quality images.
